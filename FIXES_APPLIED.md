# Fixes Applied for Hugging Face Space Deployment

## Date: October 7, 2025

## üêõ Issues Identified from HF Space Logs

### Issue 1: Permission Denied for Log Files
**Error:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/excel_debug_20251007_192324.log'
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/sqlgen_debug_20251007_192323.log'
```

**Root Cause:**
- Docker containers in HF Spaces run with restricted permissions
- `/app/` directory is read-only; cannot write log files there
- Both `sqlgen.py` and `excel_generator.py` were trying to write logs to current directory

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `sqlgen.py` and `excel_generator.py` to use `/tmp/` directory for logs (writable in Docker)
- Added fallback to console-only logging if file logging fails
- Wrapped log file creation in try-except blocks with proper error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\sqlgen.py` (lines 53-86)
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\excel_generator.py` (lines 23-59)

### Issue 2: OpenAI Client Initialization Error
**Error:**
```
WARNING - OpenAI client initialization failed: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies' - using Hugging Face models only
```

**Root Cause:**
- The error message is misleading - the code wasn't passing `proxies`
- Issue was likely from environment proxy variables or version mismatch
- Older OpenAI import patterns might have been cached

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced OpenAI client initialization with proper error handling
- Added explicit `max_retries` and `timeout` parameters
- Added fallback logic if TypeError occurs with "unexpected keyword argument"
- This ensures compatibility across different OpenAI library versions

**Files Modified:**
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\sqlgen.py` (lines 435-462)

---

### Issue 3: Local HF Model Loading Attempts
**Error:**
```
ValueError: Using a `device_map`, `tp_plan`, `torch.device` context manager or setting `torch.set_default_device(device)` requires `accelerate`. You can install it with `pip install accelerate`
```

**Root Cause:**
- System was configured to use local Hugging Face models (`USE_HF_MODELS = True`)
- Attempted to load `defog/sqlcoder-7b-2` which requires heavy dependencies
- Dependencies like `torch`, `transformers`, `accelerate` were removed to simplify deployment

**Fix Applied (Previous Commit):**
- Set `USE_HF_MODELS = False` in `sqlgen.py`
- Configured system to use API-based models only (Bedrock + OpenAI)
- Updated fallback logic to prefer OpenAI API over local models

**Files Modified:**
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\sqlgen.py` (lines 99-101)

---

### Issue 4: Gradio SDK Mismatch
**Error:**
- README.md specified `sdk: gradio` but app is Flask-based

**Fix Applied (Previous Commit):**
- Changed SDK to `docker` in README.md YAML header
- Created proper `Dockerfile` for Flask deployment
- Added `.dockerignore` for optimized builds

**Files Modified:**
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\README.md` (lines 1-9)
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\Dockerfile` (new file)
- `C:\app_sql\oracle-sql-bedrock-enhanced\.dockerignore` (new file)

## ‚úÖ Current System Architecture

### Model Priority (Working as Designed):
```
1. ü•á AWS Bedrock Claude Models (Primary)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Haiku / Opus
   ‚îî‚îÄ Uses Pinecone schema retrieval
   ‚îî‚îÄ Prevents hallucinations with dynamic schema

2. ü•à OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (Fallback)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Reliable API-based model
   ‚îî‚îÄ Uses same Pinecone schema retrieval

3. ‚ùå Local HF Models (Disabled)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Too heavy for HF Spaces environment
   ‚îî‚îÄ Requires torch, transformers, accelerate
```

### Logging Strategy (Fixed):
```
Attempt 1: Write to /tmp/ (writable in Docker)
   ‚Üì (if fails)
Fallback: Console-only logging
   ‚Üì
Always: Application continues running
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

After HF Space rebuild completes, verify:

- [ ] **Space builds successfully** without permission errors
- [ ] **Bedrock models are available** - check for "Bedrock initialized successfully" in logs
- [ ] **OpenAI fallback works** - check for "OpenAI client initialized successfully"
- [ ] **SQL generation works** - test with: "List all unpaid invoices"
- [ ] **Excel export works** - generate SQL and click "Generate Excel File"
- [ ] **Validation catches hallucinations** - retry mechanism works
- [ ] **Logs are written** - check `/tmp/` directory in container

## üîë Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in HF Space settings:

### AWS Bedrock (Primary):
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1  # or ca-central-1
```

### OpenAI (Fallback):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### Pinecone (Schema):
```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_env
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=sqlgen-schema-docs
```

```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Bedrock Still Doesn't Work:
1. Check AWS credentials are set correctly in HF Space
2. Verify AWS Bedrock console has Claude model access enabled
3. Check AWS region is correct (try `ca-central-1` if `us-east-1` fails)

### If OpenAI Fallback Fails:
1. Check OPENAI_API_KEY is set in HF Space
2. Verify API key has credits and is valid
3. Check for rate limiting errors in logs

### If Logging Still Fails:
1. Check Docker logs for permission issues
2. Verify `/tmp/` directory exists and is writable
3. Console logging should work as fallback

## ‚ú® Summary

All critical issues have been fixed:
- ‚úÖ Log files now use `/tmp/` directory (Docker-compatible)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI client initialization is robust with fallback handling
- ‚úÖ Local HF models disabled (API-only deployment)
- ‚úÖ Docker SDK properly configured for Flask app
- ‚úÖ Bedrock models remain the primary engine
- ‚úÖ OpenAI provides reliable fallback

The system is now fully compatible with Hugging Face Spaces Docker environment! üéâ
